Django/Python

Pros:
    Manageable File Count - MVC Layout is very minimal (if comparing to Ruby on Rails)
    Readability/Efficiency
    Rules by Simplicity
    Highly Responsive Command Line - errors are evaluated quickly
    URLs are written using Regular Expressions (cool!)

Cons:
    Importing that is required for Django functioning
    Classes (most aspects are defined as classes)
    FORMS - biggest challenge we faced
    Unicode issues (u'2317)
    Commands in Unix are longer (e.g. to run server: "python manage.py runserver"
    Hard to deduce errors (not as clear as Ruby on Rails)
    URLs are written using Regular Expressions (not cool!)

What we Made:
