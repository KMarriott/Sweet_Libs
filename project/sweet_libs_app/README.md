Django/Python

Pros:
    Manageable File Count - MVC Layout is very minimal (if comparing to Ruby on Rails)
    Readability/Efficiency
    Rules by Simplicity
    Highly Responsive Command Line - errors are evaluated quickly
    URLs are written using Regular Expressions (cool!)

Cons:
    Importing that is required for Django functioning
    Classes (most aspects are defined as classes)
    FORMS - biggest challenge we faced
    Unicode issues (u'2317)
    Commands in Unix are longer (e.g. to run server: "python manage.py runserver")
    Hard to deduce errors (not as clear as Ruby on Rails)
    URLs are written using Regular Expressions (not cool!)

What we Made:
    Polling App!
    Allows you to make your own poll and gather data from users
    See the results in real time
    The app graphs the data so you can measure the differences in feedback
